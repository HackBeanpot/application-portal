      In the spirit of our space theme, each attendees will be apart of a planet mission crew!
      Planet mission crews will be a space for hackers to meet and socialize with other attendees
      outside of your project team through the vacuum of empty interplanetary space. Throughout the
      weekend, you{"'"}ll have chances to win points for your new homeworld at different
      workshops/activities and compete for the Space Race to the moon.
